- The [rdf:Alt] class is the class of RDF 'Alternative' containers. It is a subclass of [rdfs:Container]. Whilst formally it is no different from an [rdf:Seq] or an [rdf:Bag], the [rdf:Alt] class is used conventionally to indicate to a human reader that typical processing will be to select one of the members of the container. The first member of the container, i.e. the value of the [rdf:_1] property, is the default choice.

+ **Definition**
- The class of RDF properties.

+ **Comments**
- The RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax specification [RDF11-CONCEPTS] describes the concept of an RDF property as a relation between subject resources and object resources.

This specification defines the concept of subproperty. The rdfs:subPropertyOf property may be used to state that one property is a subproperty of another. If a property P is a subproperty of property P', then all pairs of resources which are related by P are also related by P'. The term super-property is often used as the inverse of subproperty. If a property P' is a super-property of a property P, then all pairs of resources which are related by P are also related by P'. This specification does not define a top property that is the super-property of all properties.

+ **Definition**
- The class of RDF statements.

+ **Comments**
- [rdf:Statement] is an instance of [rdfs:Class]. It is intended to represent the class of RDF statements. An RDF statement is the statement made by a token of an RDF triple. The subject of an RDF statement is the instance of [rdfs:Resource] identified by the subject of the triple. The predicate of an RDF statement is the instance of [rdf:Property] identified by the predicate of the triple. The object of an RDF statement is the instance of [rdfs:Resource] identified by the object of the triple. [rdf:Statement] is in the domain of the properties [rdf:predicate], [rdf:subject] and [rdf:object]. Different individual [rdf:Statement] instances may have the same values for their [rdf:predicate], [rdf:subject] and [rdf:object] properties.

The [rdfs:range] of [rdf:value] is [rdfs:Resource].
